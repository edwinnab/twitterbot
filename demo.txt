I will start my essay writing with the obvious 
and basic question that first comes to the mind of
 many citizens in my country, “What is Online learning ?”. 
When I tell my not so educated parents that we will be having an
 online class  I just do not leave that statement at that, I have 
to explain further for them to be able to understand. So what is online learning,
 I ask myself what is education ? and what is learning ? 
Is there real a difference let me  define both terms separately ?
